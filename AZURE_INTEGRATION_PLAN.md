# SmartEDA Azure Integration - Plan of Actions

This document provides a clear, step-by-step plan to fully integrate the SmartEDA Data Science Platform with Microsoft Azure. It covers authentication, hosting, storage, background processing, monitoring, networking, DevOps, documentation, and social login (Auth0).

---

## 1. Azure AD Authentication & Identity

- Register the application in Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID).
- Configure redirect URIs for frontend and backend.
- Set up API permissions and client secrets.
- Integrate MSAL libraries in React frontend for login/logout/token acquisition.
- Validate Azure AD tokens in FastAPI backend using Microsoft public keys.
- Implement role management and user claims.

---

## 2. Hosting & Deployment

**Frontend:**

- Choose Azure Static Web Apps or Azure App Service for React deployment.
- Configure build and deployment pipeline (GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps).

**Backend:**

- Containerize FastAPI app (Docker).
- Deploy to Azure App Service (Linux), Azure Container Apps, or Azure Functions.
- Set up environment variables for secrets and configs.

---

## 3. Database & Storage

- Provision Azure Cosmos DB or Azure SQL Database for persistent data.
- Migrate existing data to Azure database.
- Set up Azure Blob Storage for file uploads and reports.
- Update backend to use Azure storage SDKs for file operations.

---

## 4. Background Processing & Machine Learning

- Use Azure Functions or Azure Container Apps for asynchronous EDA/ML tasks.
- Integrate with Azure Machine Learning for advanced ML workflows.
- Configure triggers and scaling for background jobs.

---

## 5. Monitoring & Logging

- Enable Azure Monitor and Application Insights for both frontend and backend.
- Set up logging, error tracking, and performance monitoring.
- Configure alerts for failures and performance issues.

---

## 6. Networking & Security

- Secure APIs with Azure API Management (rate limiting, security policies).
- Use Azure Key Vault for managing secrets, keys, and certificates.
- Configure VNETs, firewalls, and private endpoints for secure communication.
- Set up HTTPS and custom domains.

---

## 7. CI/CD & DevOps

- Use GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (Bicep, ARM, or Terraform) for resource provisioning.
- Set up staging and production environments.

---

## 8. Migration & Testing

- Refactor application for cloud readiness (stateless, config via env vars).
- Test all integrations in Azure staging environment.
- Perform load and security testing.
- Document migration steps and rollback plan.

---

## 9. Cost Management & Optimization

- Review Azure pricing and select appropriate SKUs for resources.
- Set up cost alerts and budgets in Azure Cost Management.
- Optimize resource usage and scaling policies.

---

## 10. Documentation & Training

- Update project documentation for Azure integration.
- Provide onboarding guides for team members.
- Document troubleshooting and support procedures.

---

## 11. Social Login Integration with Auth0

To enable users to sign in with Gmail or other providers, integrate Auth0 for social login:

- Register your app with Auth0 and enable social connections (Google, GitHub, etc.).
- Save your Auth0 domain and client ID.
- Install Auth0 React SDK: `npm install @auth0/auth0-react`
- Wrap your React app with `Auth0Provider` and use Auth0 hooks for login/logout/token management.
- After login, retrieve the access token and send it to your FastAPI backend for verification.
- In FastAPI, use `python-jose` to validate Auth0 tokens using Auth0's public keys.
- Restrict API endpoints to authenticated users by verifying tokens in route dependencies.

**Example Steps:**

**Frontend:**

- Add Auth0Provider and login/logout buttons using Auth0 hooks.
- Retrieve access token with `getAccessTokenSilently()` and use it in API requests.

**Backend:**

- Fetch Auth0 public keys and validate incoming tokens with `python-jose`.
- Restrict protected routes to users with valid tokens.

Auth0 handles social login and user management, while your backend verifies tokens for secure API access.
